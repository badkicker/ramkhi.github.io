					      <h2>Introduction </h2>
						  <p name="r">I'm Rama Krishna,Undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIT Guwahati.Working on anything that impacts the lives of 
                          people living in our society excites me. My focus is on developing solutions that are visually appealing and in consonance with the vision 
                           and values of company.
		                   Over the last 4 years, I have had the opportunity to develop and hone my skills in different areas of electronics and communication
                           networks. Thanks to my rich and varied experience, I am today proficient in various areas of C++, Machine Learning; VLSI - Design;Control,
                           hardware and prototyping.I am proficient in utilizing various softwares including MATLAB, Multisim, Spice, MS Office etc.

						      <h3>FPGA Implementation of LMS Adaptive Filters</h3>
							      <p id="para">Adopted a new approach for estimated speed, power consumption of adaptive filters using
                                      Redundant Arithmetic.Designed 3-tap adaptive filter in Verilog and calculated the critical path delay of the filter
                                      using Xilinx
								  </p >
							  <h3>Wheeled Robot for Remote Surveillance</h3>
							       <p id="para">Designed and developed a robot prototype with additional functionality of obstacleavoidance and speed control.The fabricated robot is also capable of sharing captured images on a Wi-Fi network for high
                                       end processing on a base – station.
								   </p>
							  <h3>Implementation of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Techniques</h3>
							       <p>Performed Face Recognition using Principal Component Analysis – Linear Discriminant
                                      Analysis (PCA - LDA) Techniques over a considerable data.<br />Implemented Gaussian Mixture Modelling for Image Segmentation.
